# natural-orbitals
A class to calculate different types of natural orbitals based on the output of electronic structure codes. 

The implementation of natural atomic orbitals (NAO) is based on: 

Reed, A.; Weinstock, R.; Weinhold, F. J. Chem. Phys. 1985, 83 (1985), 735.

Note: Spherical symmetry is not implemented. As a result, the NAOs do resemble s, p or d-orbitals. 

The implementation of natural hybrid orbitals is based on: 

Foster, J. P.; Weinhold, F. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1980, 102 (22), 7211.

The input in the example is based on a GPAW calculation.
